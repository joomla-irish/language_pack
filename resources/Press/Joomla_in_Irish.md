# About the Joomla Irish Language Project

The aim of the Joomla Irish Language Localisation Project is to provide an up-to-date translation of the core Joomla content management system (CMS) into Irish. Additionally, some commonly used optional extensions may be translated also. This is a significant project, and requires tens of thousand words to be translated for the core Joomla CMS alone.

Joomla can be used to create a single language website (e.g. Irish only, or English only), or a multilingual website (English, Irish, French, Spanish, etc). Each language requires the core Joomla CMS to be translated into that language, so that the correct text is displayed as required. For example, when filling out a contact form: ‘You must enter a subject’ becomes ‘Ní mór duit ábhar a chur isteach’ With Joomla translated into Irish, these texts are immediately available in a new website, even before any user content is added.
